Lesson 2 Project/Position Exercise - reviewed and fixed based on thinkful's design
       Mistakes: did not add in-line block to both <ul> and <li> to acheive desired effect; set box to fixed rather than relative; placed background image in html rather than on the body in css which made it difficult to use; duplicated css rather than calling both cat and dog classes when writing css
       things to remember: vertical-align: center; display: in-line block on both ul and li; set background image in body in css rather than in html
